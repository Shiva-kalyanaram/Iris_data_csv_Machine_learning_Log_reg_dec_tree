# Machine Learning Project: Iris Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model for the Iris dataset. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) using different algorithms.

## Model Accuracy

I have implemented and evaluated the performance of three algorithms:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**

The accuracy of each model was calculated and compared.

## Data Visualization

Visualizing the dataset is crucial for understanding its characteristics. I have used box plots and histograms to explore variations in the features and gain insights into the distribution of the data.

## Data Splitting

Stratified splitting was employed to ensure that each class is represented proportionally in both the training and testing sets. This is crucial for maintaining the balance in the dataset.

## Cross-Validation

Cross-validation was used to prevent overfitting and assess the generalization performance of the models. This technique involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds and training/evaluating the model on different combinations of these folds.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Knowledge about K-Fold Cross-Validation:** Understanding how to split the dataset into multiple folds and iteratively train and evaluate the model provides insights into the model's robustness.

2. **Understanding Accuracy Metrics:** Calculating and comparing accuracy metrics for different models helps in selecting the most suitable algorithm for a specific task.

3. **Data Visualization Techniques:** Box plots and histograms are valuable tools for visualizing the distribution and variations in the dataset, aiding in feature analysis.

4. **Importance of Data Splitting:** Stratified splitting ensures that the training and testing sets maintain a balanced distribution of classes, contributing to the model's performance.

5. **Preventing Overfitting with Cross-Validation:** Using cross-validation helps prevent overfitting by assessing the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data, promoting better generalization.
